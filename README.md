# Evolution Simulator

This is an Evolution Simulator involving creatures and food. The creatures have a hard-coded AI that lets them find food and find mates.
Any settings can be adjusted in the _Settings.java_ file. It includes settings such as starting health, spawn delays, mutation chances, etc.
When the project is run, the window on the left is a global fixed camera, and the right is a creature-focused camera. The window is resizeable.

Use the **LEFT ARROW** and **RIGHT ARROW** to switch the camera between creatures. 

To install, download the java files in the _src_ folder and run _Main.java_.
The other option is to download the _EvolutionSim.jar_ file.
